# akra

In this project I re-created few sections from akra.net.<br>
I made arrows and circle logo animations with css keyframes. .<br>
Created few mixins / variables and divided sass files. <br>
To make it harder I am not using any CSS framework as Bootstrap. <br>
In technologies-section I re-created tab-list with Vanilla JS.<br>
Popup header animations are hooked with wow.js and animate.css.<br>
I used few .SVG icons and compressed all images.<br>
I'll create RWD for this project later.<br>
